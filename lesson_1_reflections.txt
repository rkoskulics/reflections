It was difficult to compare the two files using diff -u
It isn't a user friendly way of looking at files
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
It will make it easier to see mistakes in changes
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Both have pluses.  It's nice not to have to remember, but it's also easier to be able to check at logical stopping points.
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Version Control Systems that focus on code are best suited to looking at multiple files in a single commit, as coding often requires multiple files for a single project
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
When in a given repository you can use the log and diff commands to see each version, as well as the changes in each version.
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
If I am worried I might break something I can use git log and git checkout to compare the two side by side, and pinpoint where the error occurred.
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I want to use it to take risks when I work on my projects
