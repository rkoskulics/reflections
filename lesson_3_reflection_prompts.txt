When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Primarily so you can work on it from multiple computers
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Clone creates a copy of a repository from one source to another.  Fork is a type of clone, but only on github's servers.  Branches exist within a single repository, which can be local or remote.
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
Having the last known copy of the remote stored locally will help prevent conflicts when collaborating with others on the same branch
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Without using git or GitHub you would have to share a single file between multiple people.  Only one person could work on it at a time.  This would be inefficient, but would prevent conflicts and would be a simpler workflow.
When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
Working in separate branch can prevent conflicts on a single file, and can allow different experiments on code.  But it can lead to difficult conflicts when merging.  Working on a master means that the information is available publicly when it may not be ready to be.
