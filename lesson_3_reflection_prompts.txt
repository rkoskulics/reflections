When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Primarily so you can work on it from multiple computers
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Clone creates a copy of a repository from one source to another.  Fork is a type of clone, but only on github's servers.  Branches exist within a single repository, which can be local or remote.
