What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When you initialize a repo it creates a hidden git file and uses that to track changes.  You can't track changes without it.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area does not reflect saving changes, whereas the repo holds all the changes.  You also can't add changes directly to it as you can a working directory.  It adds the value of just changing the files you want to change.
